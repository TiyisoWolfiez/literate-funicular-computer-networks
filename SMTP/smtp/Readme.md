Prerequisite:
Python installed environment
.env file that hold the senders email and password.
install the following packages:
pip install smtplib
pip install python-dotenv

To setup or enable the email to send the result of the quiz via your personalised email. Follow the video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_j6ILT-X0k&t=605s&ab_channel=ThePyCoach which details how to set it up.

Problem:
The code sends the wrong results to the user. That needs to be corrected.
